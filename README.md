# Force-Over-Time

Produce a Graph Demonstrating Force over time from simulated results of a force plate.

Todo: 

1. Figure out a more robust simulation method (Maybe get a sample model from another program such as blender or unreal)

2. Import more real world data

3. Methods to calculate frames and timing outside of main.py

4. Methods to add values from "for loops" to dictionaries outside of 
main.py

5. Display results in Force(N)/Time Graph

6. Display results in Force(N)/Time (ms)

7. Get total force (area under the curves) for each section
