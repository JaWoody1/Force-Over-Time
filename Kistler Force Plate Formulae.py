#Force plate simulation

#fx12 or Force in X-direction measured by sensor 1 + sensor 2
#Channel 1

#fx34 Force in X-direction measured by sensor 3 + sensor 4
#Channel 2

#fy14 Force in Y-direction measured by sensor 1 + sensor 4
#Channel 3

#fy23 Force in Y-direction measured by sensor 2 + sensor 3
#Channel 4

#fz1-fz4 Force in Z direction measured by sensor 1-4
